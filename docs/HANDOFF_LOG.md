## 2026-11-04 · Stage 3 tablet/visual/performance audit (pending)

- **Goal:** Close tablet style gap, add objective screenshot and bounded CI rendering metrics; playback logic unchanged.
- **Changes:** Extend UI2 desktop styling from 741px with 741–980px tablet adjustments; add `scripts/test-ui2-visual-audit.mjs` and GitHub Action artifact capture (synthetic UI, no personal data).
- **Tests:** New browser/visual tests pending, do not mistake GitHub runner rAF for physical-device performance.
- **Known blocker:** Preview #41677251142 failed real `稻香` alternate URL; production real Migu test also intermittently fails. Both source issues tracked separately.
- **Not done:** UI2 light theme, hands-on visual review, real-device FPS/CPU/memory, controlled release.
- **Next:** Check strict CI and artifact screenshots, fix any tablet clipping, then record verified results and three remaining macro-stages.

## 2026-11-04 · UI 2.0 phase 2 discovery, library and mobile preview verified

- **Goal:** Continue the tested phase 1 design to search/songs, playlists, ranking, library/settings and responsive phone listening experience without replacing music data or player code.
- **Changes:** [DRAFT PR #116](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/pull/116), branch `feature/fymusic-ui2-desktop-preview-20261104`, verified SHA `9bc207d7`. Scoped `src/ui2-preview.css` additions; mobile drawer/search/cards, compact floating Dock, cover-first now-playing, desktop dark collection surfaces; no audio JS or data logic changes. Added deterministic desktop/390px/320px Chromium+WebKit browser tests, style contract and preview workflow.
- **Tests:** [Phase 2 preview #41676240585](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41676240585) SUCCESS; [full browser/security #41676250254](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41676250254) SUCCESS; [playlist #41676250284](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41676250284) SUCCESS. Cloudflare deployed browser tests, 404 guard, single media element, no horizontal overflow, lyrics/artwork, and Kugou `稻香`→Kuwo playback with 48 timed lyric rows passed.
- **Issue/fix:** Initial preview #41675764216 failed only during live stylesheet check due to `curl | grep -q` premature pipe closing; corrected with download-to-file then grep. Retested successfully.
- **Preview:** https://fc82ed4d.only-testing-online-music.pages.dev/?ui2=1. Production `main` remains v0.4.33 without UI2.
- **Independent production issue:** Main workflow #41673691537 browser/security passed, but real Migu song playback timed out; do not ascribe to UI-only branch. Last prior successful main run #41670345575.
- **Not done:** Human visual review, tablet band, complete light theme, actual FPS/memory measurement, UI2 production merge; no claim of universal high-bitrate source.
- **Next action:** Review deployed preview on desktop/mobile; measure performance; refine tablet/light theme and address production Migu diagnostics separately. Keep draft PR until approved.

## 2026-11-04 · UI 2.0 desktop preview shipped to isolated Cloudflare branch (verified)

- **Goal:** Implement the first cinematic desktop UI while preserving audio, native player state, covers, synchronized lyrics and source recovery.
- **Code:** `feature/fymusic-ui2-desktop-preview-20261104`, [draft PR #116](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/pull/116), tested SHA `1d13ee4f`.
- **Changes:** `src/ui2-preview.css`, `src/ui2-preview.js` and opt-in `?ui2=1` links in `index.html`. Deep-toned immersive Now Playing, floating Dock, cover-colored static ambience, conditional UI lifecycle, no animation timers; mobile baseline unchanged.
- **Verified:** [Preview workflow #41672796071](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41672796071) SUCCESS. Chromium/WebKit desktop+mobile UI, live preview security 404, single audio node, art/lyric visibility, play/pause/resume, reduced motion. [Browser/security #41672843044](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41672843044), [playlist #41672843520](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41672843520), [privacy #41672843842](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41672843842) all SUCCESS.
- **Real source:** `稻香` Kugou error recovered into Kuwo alternate audio (progress), cover loaded, 48 timed lyrics. A `128k` request was observed, not measured codec/bitrate.
- **Preview:** [isolated UI 2.0 test site](https://821da531.only-testing-online-music.pages.dev/?ui2=1); `main` and official production remain v0.4.33.
- **Not done:** Visual sign-off, actual FPS/performance measurements, mobile UI 2.0, search/library redesign, merging or deploying to production.
- **Next action:** User design review of preview, then refine desktop and implement phase 2 mobile/search/library with new CI gates. Update handoff after the next milestone.

## 2026-11-03 · Handoff protocol established

- **Input / motivation:** Future conversations must recover technical progress after a context limit, without relying exclusively on chat memory.
- **Repository verified:** `lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music` is PUBLIC. No accessible PRIVATE repository was found at initialization.
- **Action:** Added a public-safe current-state checkpoint, an append-only operation log, recovery instructions, privacy policy and a secret-pattern check. The public README links to the handoff.
- **Deliverable:** `docs/HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`, `docs/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `docs/HANDOFF_POLICY.md`, `scripts/check-handoff-privacy.mjs`, `.github/workflows/handoff-privacy.yml`.
- **Data protection:** Deliberately excludes personal identifiers, private conversations, private Figma file identifiers, access tokens, sensitive URLs, unshared files and account data. Technical details are already public in this project's repository/history.
- **Baseline verification:** v0.4.33 main `e67071dd`; release Actions run #41650815801 `completed / success`. Privacy static scan is required for this checkpoint change.
- **Status:** Documentation/protocol setup; does NOT implement UI 2.0.
- **Open issue:** The current repository cannot provide private storage. Use a separate PRIVATE repository for future confidential notes, once available and authorized.
- **Next action:** On a UI 2.0 feature branch, implement the desktop now-playing frame and floating player as an isolated preview. Update these documents in the same change before declaring that operation complete.

## 2026-11-03 · UI 2.0 design prototype

- **Goal:** Improve modern desktop/mobile visual quality and animation while preserving music playback.
- **Completed:** Five editable design screens: desktop dark discover, desktop dark immersive player, mobile discover, mobile now-playing and desktop light theme, plus motion/performance/accessibility guidance in Figma.
- **Not completed:** No implementation or animation is live; no changes to production UI from this design step.
- **Next action:** Build and verify the separate UI 2.0 preview; do not publish design work to the production domain until tests pass.

## 2026-11-03 · v0.4.33 autoplay and audio-quality regression fix

- **Code:** [PR #114](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/pull/114), main baseline commit `e67071dd`.
- **Verified:** `NotAllowedError` resume, `NotSupportedError` handling, `AbortError` classification, declared-quality-first selection, preview `稻香` alternative playback with cover and 48 lyric lines, production regression pass.
- **Evidence:** [main release run #41650815801](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/actions/runs/41650815801) `success`.
- **Limitation:** The real alternative source returned a 128k request in that test; actual encoding/bitrate was not measured. Browser autoplay restrictions can require a direct user gesture.

## 2026-11-03 · Historical Pages files guard

- **Code:** [PR #113](https://github.com/lxhlw/Only-testing-online-music/pull/113).
- **Verified:** Public README and old repository paths receive protected 404 responses in preview and production, normal player app files continue static delivery.
- **Next action:** Retain the strict allowlist and guard during UI 2.0 changes.
